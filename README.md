`slk` is a daily-driver replacement for the official Slack desktop client, built in Go with [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

## Why slk?

- **Fast.** Cold start in milliseconds. Render-cached messages. SQLite-backed scrollback. Real-time over WebSocket.
- **Tiny.** ~19 MB on disk. ~60 MB RSS for a live multi-workspace session vs. 500 MB–1.5 GB for the official client. No node_modules, no Chromium, no 1Gb RAM tax.
- **Keyboard-first.** Vim-style modal editing. `j/k`, `h/l`, `i`, `Esc`.
- **Pretty.** 35+ built-in themes, lipgloss-styled panels, true-pixel avatars on kitty (half-block fallback elsewhere), emoji shortcodes, day separators, and pill-style reactions.
- **Multi-workspace.** All your workspaces stay connected in parallel. `1`–`9` to instantly jump between them, with live unread badges in the rail.
- **Yours.** TOML config, custom themes, custom channel sections via glob, XDG-compliant paths.

## Highlights

- Real-time messages, edits, deletes, reactions, typing indicators
- Inline images (kitty graphics / sixel / half-block fallback) with full-screen preview
- Threads side panel + a workspace-wide threads view
- Smart paste: clipboard images, file paths, or text — multiple attachments + caption in one send
- Slack-native sidebar sections, kept live; or glob-based config sections
- Browser-cookie auth (`xoxc` + `d`) — no Slack App required
- Vim-style modal keybindings, fuzzy channel finder, workspace picker
- 12 themes + drop-in custom themes, live theme switcher
- OS desktop notifications on DMs, mentions, and configurable keywords

## Quick install

**Homebrew** (macOS and Linux):

```bash
brew install gammons/tap/slk
```

**Linux/macOS tarball** (auto-resolves the latest version):

```bash
VERSION=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/gammons/slk/releases/latest | grep -oE '"tag_name": *"v[^"]+"' | grep -oE 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' | sed 's/^v//')
# Linux x86_64
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/gammons/slk/releases/latest/download/slk_${VERSION}_linux_x86_64.tar.gz" | tar xz
# macOS Apple Silicon
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/gammons/slk/releases/latest/download/slk_${VERSION}_darwin_arm64.tar.gz" | tar xz
sudo mv slk /usr/local/bin/
```

**Go:**

```bash
go install github.com/gammons/slk/cmd/slk@latest
```

For `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.apk` packages, Windows, build-from-source, and checksums, see the [Installation wiki page](https://github.com/gammons/slk/wiki/Installation).

## Setup

slk uses your existing browser session. Grab your `xoxc` token and `d`
cookie from DevTools, then:

```bash
slk --add-workspace
```

Full walkthrough: [Setup wiki page](https://github.com/gammons/slk/wiki/Setup).

## Inline images in tmux

If you run `slk` inside tmux on a Kitty-capable terminal (Kitty, Ghostty,
WezTerm), images render natively as long as tmux passthrough is enabled:

```tmux
set -g allow-passthrough on
```

Reload tmux for the setting to take effect (`tmux kill-server`, then
reattach). Verify with:

```bash
tmux show -gv allow-passthrough
```

Expected output: `on` (or `all`).

If passthrough is off, `slk` detects this at startup and falls back to
half-block rendering automatically — no config change needed. To force a
specific renderer regardless of detection, set `image_protocol` in
`config.toml` to `kitty`, `sixel`, `halfblock`, or `off`.

## Debugging

Set `SLK_DEBUG=1` to enable a comprehensive debug log written to
`slk-debug.log` in the current working directory. The file is
**truncated each run**, so reproduce the issue, quit slk, then copy
the file before relaunching. Log lines are categorized
(`[cache]`, `[imgfetch]`, `[imgrender]`, `[ws]`, `[general]`) so
`grep '\[cache\]' slk-debug.log` slices to one focus area.
